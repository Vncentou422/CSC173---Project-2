# CSC173---Project-2
Project 2- Grammars and Parsing
Collaborators: Timothy Chu, Griffin van de Venne, Vincent Ou


Note: For Part 3 the program was intended to recieve infix after reading a tree. Didnt have time to implement but the infix calculator works. 
Input is (x operand y) requiring a set of () for every operand as well as a \n at the end of the string.

a) In a Bash shell, run:
make -f Makefile.#
(# corresponds to the part of the project [1,2,3])

b) Test cases are coded into the programs
You can change the words being tested by modifying the .c files listed above
Just run the output file from the makefile


c) Timothy Chu & Griffin van de Venne & Vincent Ou

d) We used the sample files from Prof Ferguson

make -f Makefile.1
./recurse

make -f Makefile.2
./tdp

make -f Makefile.3
./infix
